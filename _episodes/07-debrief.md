## Code Review
Code review adds a social aspect to the typically solitary work of development.
Giving feedback to people can be challenging after working on software for a while,
remember to change your audience and mentality.  Receiving feedback can also be
difficult; reviews can feel like they are attacking how your think instead of
how you code.

Still, code review greatly improves projects, saving time and money in substantial
amounts.  When starting, remember that self reviews are useful practice and can
improve PRs prior to merging. Talking and sharing your expertise can be fun!
